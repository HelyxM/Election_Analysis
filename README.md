## **Overview of Election Audit**:
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to review the data collected from the election and determine the major conclusions from the results. By writing a script that would analyze the data presented in the worksheet, the most important conclusions of the election can be quickly and easily retrieved and presented in a text file from a single code file. The benefits from not having to count hundreds of thousands of individual values and calculate results based on them are numerous, the most notable being reduced labor and a reduced possibility for inaccuracy. In addition to these benefits, the code structure provided in this analysis can also be easily adapted for use in other elections of similar types.
